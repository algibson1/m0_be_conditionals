# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?
It is useful if there is more than one pathway that could occur based on user input. Something only happens under *the condition* of something else been met.

1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
I would comment out more things to "clean up" the results on my terminal, so I can check myself faster.

1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?
When doing the mild challenge, I first thought "Well, to check if something is even or odd, I need to check what digit it ends in." So I tried googling for how to check the final digit/character in an integer.

After that ended up confusing and complicated, I realized there was probably a simpler way, so instead I googled how to write a program to check if an integer is even or odd. And I got a much simpler result.

What I learned from that is I need to research the exact solution I need, not the solution I THINK I need.
